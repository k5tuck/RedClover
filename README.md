## About RedClover

After doing various research on fintechs and how they operated, a spark of interest was raised on how they do things technology wise.
However, finding information (or even examples), of backend finance projects was proving to be difficult to find. So what better way
is there to learn about something, than to make it yourself?

The project was structured around the "core banking" concept that banks have used for more than a couple of decades now. The current plan is
to create a monolithic architecture to get a basic understaning of how banks kind of work "under the hood".

### Future Plans

There are a couple of ideas for future iterations, with more to come in the future:

- Create a Microservice Architecture
- Eventually re-implement the server into a Go "version"

### Built Using

- JavaScript: Node.js, Express, Sequelize
- PostgreSQL
- Deployed with: AWS (Coming Soon)
